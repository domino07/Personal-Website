                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p align="center">HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Languge. It is used to <br>
                        design web pages using markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and <br>
                        Markup Language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. Markup language us used to <br>
                        define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages. This language <br>
                        is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and <br>
                        manipulate text accordingly. Most of markup (e.g HTML) languages are human readable. Language <br>
                        uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text. <br>
                        
                        HTML is a markup language which is used by the browser to manipulate text, images and other content <br>
                        to display it in required format. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first ever version <br>
                        of HTML was HTML 1.0 but the first standard version was HTML 2.0 which was published in 1999</p>
